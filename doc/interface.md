# Interface

Immersive's interface consists of text overlays drawn on top of the video,
referred to as menus. If you opened a menu on top of another one (e.g. by
pressing `Ctrl`+`A` to switch the active dictionary before looking up a
word), you can go back to the previous menu at any time by hitting `ESC`.
`Shift`+`ESC` clears all active menus. The data of each menu will be
preserved until it is closed with (`Shift`+)`ESC` or by performing an action
that closes it automatically, such as exporting a card.

Internally menus are kept track of with a stack. Every new menu is pushed on
top of the previous one (which is then hidden) and `ESC` removes the last added
menu and reactivates the one before/below. `Shift`+`ESC` empties the stack.

Each menu has a togglable overview of available key bindings at the top left.
The key bindings listed there are specific to that menu, unless their
description ends in "(global)". Some menus also include a list of information
relevant to the menu at the bottom left.


## Global Menu

The global menu can always be opened using `Ctrl`+`a`. It contains an overview
of Immersive's global key bindings, as well as information on the series
ID/title and on whether autocopy and screenshots are enabled.


## Dictionary/Target Menu

This menu can be opened with `Ctrl`+`A` and allows switching between
dictionary groups and Anki targets. It also shows which one is currently
active for both. If you have selected the wrong group or target, it's
possible to change them here even if you are about to look up a word or
export a card.


## Active Subtitle Lookup

By pressing `k`, you can bring up a menu that allows looking up words from the
current line outside of the card creation process. It functions almost
identically to the target word selection menu.

## Messages

Messages are displayed at the top right of the screen. White text signifies an
informational message, yellow text a warning, red text an error and text that
is bright red and bold a fatal error in the script (which should never happen,
of course).

All messages visible in this interface (and a few others not relevant to the
user) are also printed to the mpv console (`Ë‹`/`~`) as well as to the system
console/terminal (if mpv is connected to one) using the mpv's internal messaging
system.
